This module contains all the views supported in the Django app. These are
nothing more than Python methods which always take the
django.http.HttpRequest class as their first argument and return a
django.http.HttpResponse class or a subclass of it.

See https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/request-response/ for
more information about request objects received and response object to
return.

See https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/http/shortcuts/ for
information about shortcut methods like the :meth:`django.shortcuts.render`
method which is helpful in rendering a response from a Django template.

### So, I was looking at the giant if statements in your code, and I think you can move just about everything 
### out of the if statements. 
### It is a little difficult to tell, because I don’t know what ‘reverse’ is doing or where it comes from. 
### This is because you have a couple of import statements here where you import everything (*). 
### I highly advise against doing this. I know it shows up in examples, 
### but if you only import what you need, then you can see where everything comes from, and you are not importing
### lots of extraneous stuff.
